###To run this application,

##Make dev.js file  and put mongoDB root under config folder

#Needs " npm install " inside the root directory to download Server Dependencies
#Needs " npm install " inside the client directory to download Front-end Dependencies 

This program has issue with connecting Heroku. 
Heroku running is fine, but cannot get image file from mongoDB server.
I am still try to figure out this issue now. 
Other then every thing is fine.
